 * currentSpaceId (which, for a cross-space share, is a DIFFERENT space).
 *
 * Why a DEDICATED `?sp` and NOT the link's `?sid` (XIN-501, boss real-device evidence): `?sid` is

 * role guard (role `none` → 403 forbidden). Because the sid never equals the doc's space_id, that

 * the preflight from the doc's real space (`?sp`) lets the backend evaluate the caller's role in the
 * doc's space: 200 for a member/owner, 403 for a no-permission caller (→ request-access), 404 only
 * when the doc is genuinely gone. The `token<sid>` logic is untouched — `?sid` still keys the token.
 *
 * Returns '' when the link carries no `?sp=` (older links minted before XIN-501, or under SSR);

 * Standalone document page (octo-web #512) — the full-window view a shared `/d/:docId` link opens,
 * outside the app shell / NavRail. It reuses the in-shell EditorShell for collaboration parity
 * (AC-5/6) and only adds the standalone chrome: "Copy link". Sharing a link is the whole point of a
 * standalone view, so the loaded editor offers no "back to all documents" return link (XIN-416, boss
 * real-device acceptance) — users arrive here from an external chat link, not from inside the shell,
 * and a pure share page needs no entry back into the doc list. The page therefore passes NO onBack to
 * EditorShell; for the same reason the preflight error terminals (below) also render without a Back
 * link (XIN-505) — a share surface has no resident list to return to.
 *
 * "Copy link" is collapsed into the header's ≡ "more" menu (as its top row) rather than sitting as a
 * resident title-bar button, keeping the standalone header as trim as the in-shell one. The clipboard
 * behaviour is unchanged — only its position moved. Because selecting a menu row closes the menu (the
 * panel unmounts), the "Link copied" confirmation cannot live inside the row; it surfaces as a brief
 * menu-external toast rendered by this page instead (reusing the docs package's document-external
 * transient-toast convention, the same fixed overlay style as the image upload status/error toasts).
 *
 * A GET /api/v1/docs/{docId} preflight runs BEFORE the collaborative editor mounts. This is the
 * single deterministic gate for every boundary state, and it needs no WebSocket:
 *   - 200          -> mount the editor.
 *   - 403 forbidden (AC-7), 404 not-found (AC-10), 401 login (AC-11), 409 locked/archived (AC-12)
 *     -> render the matching terminal screen (a centered card; the forbidden landing adds Request
 *     access, XIN-505). 409 is the archived signal the collab-token path never reports, which is
 *     exactly why the preflight exists.
 *
 * `docId` is nullable: the host Layout claims the whole `/d` namespace, so a malformed / empty id
 * (`/d/`, `/d/a:b`) arrives here as null and short-circuits to the not-found terminal instead of
